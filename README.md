# MiSoC MML Working Papers

We put here our work that is currently under development. Updates will be made as we make progress, including links to external venues.

## Working Papers
- Undersmoothing Causal Estimators with Generative Trees [[link](Undersmoothing_Data_Augmentation.pdf)][[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08570)]
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation in Causal Effect Estimation [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412)]
- Robustness of Algorithms for Causal Structure Learning to Hyperparameter Choice [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18212)]
