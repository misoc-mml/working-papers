# MiSoC MML Working Papers

We put here our work that is currently under development. Updates will be made as we make progress, including links to external venues.

## Working Papers
- Undersmoothing Data Augmentation To Reduce Bias for Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation from Observational Data [[link](Undersmoothing_Data_Augmentation.pdf)][[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08570)]
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation in Causal Effect Estimation [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412)]

## Talks
- The Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning in Causal Effect Estimation ([CDSM22](https://www.causalscience.org/meeting/programme/programme-2022/)) - [slides](Model%20Selection%20in%20Causal%20Effect%20Estimation%20-%20CDSM22.pdf)
